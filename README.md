# UCI Catalogue Degree Plan Scraper

## Overview

This tool is designed to scrape degree plans from the [UCI Catalogue](https://catalogue.uci.edu) and automates the process of extracting degree plan tables, including course sequences and links to specific course information, from the universityâ€™s catalogue. The scraped data is used to assist in curricular analytics, with a specific focus on integrating it with the **UCI Curricular Analytics** project.

## How It Works

This tool web scrapes pages from the UCI Catalogue, focusing on the degree plan tables for undergraduate programs. It:

- Navigates to specific degree program pages.
- Locates and extracts the degree plan tables, including the course sequences for different years (Freshman through Senior).
- Captures hyperlinks associated with each course for further information retrieval.
- Processes both normal course listings and dynamically loaded content (like tooltips or pop-ups with additional course details).

The scraper makes use of **Python**, primarily leveraging:

- `requests`: To fetch the HTML content from UCI's Catalogue.
- `BeautifulSoup`: To parse and extract the degree plan tables.
- `pandas`: To store the scraped data in a structured format (DataFrame) for further analysis or export.
